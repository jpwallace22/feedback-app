# Feedback UI

## [Live project can be viewed here](https://feedback-jw.vercel.app).

### `A bit about the project`

This is a simple React project built to help me learn the basic CRUD workflow. It is a small UI to add or edit feedback. I originally had a mock backend but will soon replace with Express and MongoDB.

### `Dependencies`

- Framer Motion
- UUID
- Concurrently (development)
- ~~Mock backend is with JSON server~~
